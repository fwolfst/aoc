# AoC 2020

## Notes

So far, all puzzles read their input via `ARGF` (either pipe or enter data via
STDIN  or pass file name(s) as argument).

All done quick and dirty, basically without revisiting.  Don't want to win a
beauty-award here.

### Puzzle 1

Puzzle #1 input at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1/input but need
authentication to download.

I do not yet know how mean the puzzles are, so I assume a friendly input
(positive integers).

Quite some time pressure, I go without tests and super-iterative brute-force approach.

### Puzzle 2

I can obviously extend the first puzzles solution.  Messy code, but will work.
If the next puzzle wants an abstraction (*find `n` numbers summing to `m`*), I
will have to rethink.

### Puzzle 3
### Puzzle 4
We keep our course to iteratists heaven. Finally, use XOR-operator (`^`).

### Puzzle 5
When to extract geo-functions?  Have not yet created a single class, but my
first methods :)
It feels hacky as in the 90s, but way more evil than back then.

### Puzzle 6
Would feel good if I refactor a bit first. Did the bare minimum and will not
understand the solution anymore in t+2h.

### Puzzle 7 (day4#1)
Used a `Struct`. Yay!

### Puzzle 8 (day4#2)
Regexp galore.

### Puzzle 9 (day5#1)
Overdoing ranges. Index zero.
### Puzzle 10 (day5#2)

### Puzzle 11
### Puzzle 12
Break out of a single block iteration using `next <value>`.
