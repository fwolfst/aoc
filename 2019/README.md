# AoC 2019

## Notes

So far, all puzzles read their input via `ARGF` (either pipe or enter data via
STDIN  or pass file name(s) as argument).

All done quick and dirty, basically without revisiting.  Don't want to win a
beauty-award here.

### Day 1 - Puzzle 1
Straight.
### Day 1 - Puzzle 2
Recursion!

### Day 2 - Puzzle 3
Not sure if I found a bug in structs getter/setter. Had naming issues.
### Day 2 - Puzzle 4
Brute-force. Nice that the problem description would help to get rid of the
naming issus.
