You can save the key you get after oauth auth in a file called e.g. 2020.key .
It will be gitignored.

All done quick and dirty, basically without revisiting.  Don't want to win a
beauty-award here.

There is a strong urge to build tools around the AoC itself (downloading
description, data, tests, templates etc). I am strong and resist.
