# AoC 2021

## Notes

This year I will not be able to spend as much time on this. So, I do not aim
for somewhat readable code in the problem domain, but want to find the
solution. Besides, I would be happy to increase my writing skills (e.g.
practising by
writing the notes below)

I assume all puzzles will read their input via `ARGF` (either pipe or enter data via
STDIN  or pass file name(s) as argument).

I try to add use a `-d` (debug) flag to the programs.

## Puzzle Day I

Like last year, I already know that I will wonder whether automating the data
download is worth the time and fun.

### Part 2

Solved each puzzle with `each_cons(n)`.
Biggest problem was to put the `-d` flag for debug output in the right place
and fighting with OSX terminal and MBP/OSX keyboard. I guess they didnt print
the most interesting special characters on the keyboard due to visual design
consinderations. Of course, "â‚¬" and "$" has to be there, though.
